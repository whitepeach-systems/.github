**hey there! we make AI stuff and no-code tools that don't suck** ✨

so you wanna create cool stuff but don't know how to code? or maybe you just want AI to do the heavy lifting? perfect, you've found the right place. we're all about making creation accessible to literally everyone.

🌐 **hang out with us**: [whitepeach.vercel.app](https://whitepeach.vercel.app)  
💬 **join the chaos**: [discord.gg/s8j4AKvC8m](https://discord.gg/s8j4AKvC8m)

## what we're about 🤔

honestly? we just think everyone should be able to bring their wild ideas to life, even if they can't tell HTML from a sandwich. our tools are basically the bridge between "i have this crazy idea" and "holy crap i actually built something."

## our cool stuff 🔨

### 🎭 [PsychoStory](https://psychostory.vercel.app)
**crafting perfect prompts for AI storytelling**

tired of getting mediocre stories from AI? this thing builds highly specialized prompts with a friendly interface that'll make Claude, GPT, and Gemini actually give you the good stuff. characters, world-building, plot twists - we help you ask for exactly what you want.

### 🎨 [ArcticPlunge](https://arcticplunge.vercel.app)
**character creation that doesn't make you cry**

make Character.AI compatible characters without wanting to throw your computer out the window. clean interface, smart suggestions, and no more "why won't this work" moments.

### 🎬 [FilmScene](https://filmscene.vercel.app)
**API testing but make it aesthetic**

testing APIs usually sucks, so we made it not suck. dark theme, clean design, and you'll actually enjoy poking around with different endpoints. it's like having a movie director's view of your API calls.

### 🤖 Iridescence
**discord bots for people who can't code** (coming soon!)

drag, drop, done. build discord bots with zero programming knowledge. we're still putting the finishing touches on this one, but it's gonna be pretty sweet.

## why you'll love it 😍

- **zero coding required** - seriously, none
- **AI does the thinking** - let the robots handle the boring stuff
- **visual everything** - drag and drop your way to success
- **deploy instantly** - see your stuff come alive right away
- **awesome community** - we're pretty cool people, ngl

## who this is for 👉

- **content creators** - make stories, characters, and content without the headache
- **no-code enthusiasts** - build apps like it's 2025 (because it is)
- **discord server owners** - get bots without learning javascript
- **idea people** - turn those shower thoughts into actual things

## the numbers 📈

- **1K+** people making cool stuff
- **50K+** projects that actually work  
- **99.9%** uptime (we're pretty reliable)
- **4** tools that don't disappoint

## how to get started 🚀

1. **pick a tool** - they're all pretty great tbh
2. **mess around** - click stuff, drag things, have fun
3. **deploy** - watch your creation go live and feel like a wizard

## wanna test beta stuff? 🧪

if you're into trying things before they're "done" (aka you like living dangerously), check out our [beta tester terms](https://github.com/whitepeach-systems/beta-tester-tos/blob/main/README.md). fair warning: you might see some broken stuff, but that's half the fun, right?

## come hang out 👋

we've got a pretty chill discord server where people share their creations, ask questions, and occasionally send memes. join us: [discord.gg/s8j4AKvC8m](https://discord.gg/s8j4AKvC8m)
